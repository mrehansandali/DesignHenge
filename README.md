Hello,

While working on your task, I didn't focus much on the header's navbar as there was a shortage of time. However, I did create the testimonial slider according to your requirements. I would have shown more creativity, but again, the time was quite limited. You gave me two tasks to complete in 24 hours, and finishing this first task in one day was quite challenging. Nevertheless, I took a half-day off from my job and completed it after returning home.

During the creation of this task, I had to repeat some images because the ratios of a few images in the PSD file you provided were not proper.

For this task, I used Slick Slider for creating the Sliders, and a bit of Bootstrap, though most of it is my own custom CSS.

To view the task, you will need to open it in your code editor, and first, you'll have to install the node modules by running the "npm i" command, and then you can start the development server by running "npm run start" command.

After that, you can view it on your local server.

I have also made it live on Netlify so that you can easily view it live, without having to set up a development server, HEre is the link "https://kratom.netlify.app/".

I hope you will like my Task No. 01.

Regards, Rehan Sandali
Thanks
